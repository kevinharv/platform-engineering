# Platform Engineering Lab/Project

*Building foundational automation and self-service infrastructure management capabilities.*

## Overview

The objective of this lab is to construct a self-service platform that enables developers and IT administrators to request and automatically provision computing resources in adherence with best practice and thoughtful guardrails. Initially, it will focus on support for AWS resources, with some capabilities for on-premises infrastructure. This project will leverage Ansible and AWX (or Ansible Automation Platform) to create easy-to-use and reliable automated workflows.

## Roadmap

1. Build out foundational AWS infrastructure
1. Build out Ansible AWX
1. Build basic automation workflows
1. Build self-service platform

## Notes
### Documentation Conventions

**Hostnames**
[location][environment][tier][app][identifier]

Ex: awspnvpn1 (AWS Production Network VPN 1)

**Tagging**
- Follow AWS naming conventions for AWS resources
